"""
Hey there! The purpose of this module is to provide a convenient way for a user to depend upon all boost libraries as a single module.
All the boost libraries are aliased and accessible by using the syntax @boost//:libraryName

This file is from https://github.com/dynacondev/boost.rules
If you're looking to maintain or edit some Boost Modules from the BCR, check out https://github.com/dynacondev/boost.rules.tools for the tool you'll need! Happy Coding!
